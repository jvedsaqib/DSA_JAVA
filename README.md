# DSA_JAVA
Some programs related to Data Structures and Algorithms in Java.
I will try my best to update this repo as much as I can !

This repo contains the following programs :
  
  1. Array:
  
    1-1. Array implementation and some functions - secondLargest, moveZero, resizeArr, missingNum, reverse
    
  2. LinkedList:
    
    2-1. SinglyLinkedList and some functions - display, getSize, getHead, getLast, addNodeAtFront, addNodeAtLast, deleteNodeAtFront, deleteNodeAtLast, addNodeAtSpecificPosition, deleteNodeAtSpecificPosition, searchNode, reverseList
    
    2-2. DoublyLinkedList and some functions like SLL
    
    2-3. CirularLinkedList and some functions like SLL
    
  3. Stack:
   
    3-1. Stack implementaion and some functions - push, pop, display, peek, getLength
    
    3-2. String Reverse using stack
  4. Sorting & Searching:
    
    4-1. Binary Search
    
    4-2. Bubble Sort
  5. Graph:
    
    5-1. Graph adjacancy matrix
    
    5-2. Graph adjacancy list, dfs, bfs
    
  6. Binary Search Tree:
  
    6-1. BST implementation, preOrder traversal, inOrder traversal
